            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  For over a century, International House has stood as a “home away from home” for hundreds of international students and young professionals each year, providing safe and accessible housing for a community that often faces barriers to navigating one of the most competitive and expensive rental markets in the country.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Located in Morningside Heights, I-House was one of the first residential spaces dedicated to serving international communities, including those of all financial backgrounds. One of its many attractive features to students and young professionals is that while many New York City housing options require guarantors—a person or company that legally agrees to pay rent if the tenant cannot—I-House lifts such barriers at its dorm-like residence.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As one student and former resident put it, “International House saved my life.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  This convenience, however, comes at a cost. I-House residents must sign a “resident membership agreement” that deprives residents of their tenant rights—which, in New York City, include good cause evictions and notice periods. By signing, residents agree that they are not tenants and “I-House is not a landlord,” according to a copy of the agreement obtained by Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  During the peak of the global COVID-19 pandemic, I-House made<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/3/26/panic-as-ny-intl-dorm-orders-students-out-amid-covid-19-lockdown"> national headlines</a> when it gave its residents just eight days to evacuate after one student died in the building, leaving hundreds in the housing community without a place to live.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Since then, and amid the federal government’s <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2025/04/06/federal-government-terminates-visas-of-four-international-students-university-says/">crackdown</a> on international students, these sudden notices of evacuation have continued. Spectator interviewed four residents whom I-House gave less than three-weeks notice to move out, and reviewed email correspondence between I-House and tenants that revealed how the housing community’s exemption from tenant laws can leave residents in crisis.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While three are still fighting to remain in their residences, one resident was forced to leave due to the notice and currently lives in a homeless shelter.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Legal experts told Spectator that while the resident membership agreement waives residents’ tenant rights under New York state law, the practice is not unique to I-House and seen among similar living spaces.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “We treat our residents fairly and with dignity and respect, and categorically reject any suggestion otherwise,” an I-House spokesperson<b> </b>wrote in a statement to Spectator. “We reiterate that our policy is not to comment publicly on matters between International House and its residents.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A spokesperson for I-House declined to make I-House administrators available for an interview.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Three residents spoke to Spectator on the condition of anonymity, citing retaliation from I-House. The residents chose pseudonyms by which they are referred. CoryTerrell Jenkins spoke to Spectator on the record with his real name.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Aya, a Columbia graduate and I-House resident, said these values of respect drew her to I-House.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I really resonated with the community values and I thought it would be a good opportunity to live with people around the world,” she told Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Residents typically live at I-House for three academic years, but can apply to extend their residency, according to the membership agreement. The agreement does not include a statement on granting residents any notice about the status of their extension request before they must leave the unit.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In July, I-House denied Aya’s extension request to live there for a fourth year, leaving her with 19 days to find alternate housing.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I had such a positive relationship with International House beforehand,” Aya said. “I’ve recommended living at International House to multiple people and I never expected to be in this situation. It’s been very upsetting.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  <b>The ‘resident membership agreement’</b>
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Founded in 1924 with funding from John D. Rockefeller Jr., I-House is an independent nonprofit organization located on 500 Riverside Dr. between 122nd and La Salle streets. Its mission statement says that it serves to offer “an environment in which individuals from different backgrounds live, learn, and collaborate.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Predating the United Nations, I-House has appointed former U.S. Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Gerald Ford, and former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger, Henry Stimson, and George Marshall as chairs of its board.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The two-building residential community can house up to 700 residents that currently hail from around 90 countries and regions. About one-third of the residents are from the United States. The community holds approximately 10 programs a week, including club sports, cultural events, and musical performances.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Upon moving into I-House, residents must sign the “resident membership agreement.” The agreement specifies that residents are not subject to “federal, state or New York City rent stabilization laws or other laws, or regulations associated with leases, the payment of rent, or any other rights and obligations of landlords and tenants.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Under New York state law, if an owner does not want to renew a tenant’s lease, they must give a tenant at least 90 days’ notice if the tenant has lived there for at least two years or has a lease term for at least two years. Because of the agreement they sign, I-House residents are not afforded that protection.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It appears that such an agreement is against public policy and is designed to circumvent the New York landlord tenant laws, which I don’t think that you can do,” Keith Altman, founder of K Altman Law, a law firm specializing in student defense, told Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Joshua, a General Studies student and I-House resident<b>,</b> said that in depriving residents of tenant rights, I-House is “taking advantage of the fact that people don’t know better.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Maria Foscarinis, BC ’77, Law ’81, founder and former executive director of the National Homelessness Law Center, told Spectator that the agreement is “not unique” to I-House.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It applies in other situations as well, primarily co-living arrangements … people live in a building that’s designed to be more like a community than a standard apartment building, standard leases,” Foscarinis said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  I-House operates similarly to Columbia Residential—a University program that offers off-campus housing to students and faculty. However, unlike I-House, Columbia Residential does establish a tenant-landlord relationship, according to a June copy of a Columbia Residential lease obtained by Spectator. If a student chooses to renew their agreement, Columbia Residential gives residents their renewal agreement one to two months before the end of the agreement, according to its website, a clause that is not in the I-House agreement.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  While many of I-House’s living conditions and community programming are similar to those of college dorms, I-House does not qualify as a dorm under New York state law because it is not owned or operated by an institution that provides a full-time course of study.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Instead, students must submit an application—including a written statement—to live in I-House, which has a roughly 33 percent acceptance rate. The admissions committee reviews applications on “​individual​ ​merit,​ ​commitment​ ​to​ ​the​ International​ ​House mission,​ ​and​ ​a willingness​ ​to​ ​share​ ​their​ ​time​ ​and​ ​talent​ ​with​ ​the​ ​I-House​ ​community​ ​through​ ​its​ ​varied​ ​programs,” according to I-House’s admissions <a href="https://admissions.ihouse-nyc.org/admission/">web page</a>.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Before 2020, Columbia would lease some units from I-House and sublease them to graduate students, a University official confirmed to Spectator.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Joshua said he moved into I-House in 2018 by getting off the waitlist at Columbia Residential.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Admission to I-House during the academic year is exclusively reserved for students, visiting scholars, interns, or trainees, who are graduate students or recent graduates within their first year of graduation working in their field of study.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  For international students, living in I-House alleviates many of the typical challenges that arise when apartment hunting in New York City.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  For example, in many New York City apartments, landlords can ask potential tenants to show that their income is greater than 40 times their monthly rent. In the case that the tenant cannot provide this information, tenants may need to seek a guarantor, who may have to show the landlord that their annual income is up to 80 times the tenant’s monthly rent. Guarantor services recommended by Columbia Residential often charge non-U.S. citizens a higher fee. In its financial verification, I-House does not require residents to display a certain amount of money in their bank account or ask for a guarantor—it only asks for proof of ability to pay for tuition and living expenses.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  I-House offers need-based and merit-based financial aid to its residents, prioritizing students from “underrepresented countries or field of studies.” Students can receive up to a full year of rent in financial aid. In the past, I-House wrote on its website that it has offered some amount of financial aid to 30 percent of its residents.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Though not knowing much about I-House prior to living there, Joshua said he enjoyed his time at the residence hall.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s close to campus, there’s events, there’s a dining hall, it’s awesome,” Joshua said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  But then, in 2020, crisis struck.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In March 2020, as Columbia was asking its students to evacuate from campus amid the emerging pandemic, an I-House resident <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2020/03/23/an-international-house-resident-has-died-from-covid-19-columbia-evacuated-hundreds-of-students-days-prior/">died</a> after contracting COVID-19.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In response, I-House vacated all of its units, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/3/26/panic-as-ny-intl-dorm-orders-students-out-amid-covid-19-lockdown">giving</a> its residents eight days to leave. Some of the residents, particularly international students, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/3/26/panic-as-ny-intl-dorm-orders-students-out-amid-covid-19-lockdown">expressed</a> concerns about having to leave their housing in the middle of the pandemic.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Though there was a 90-day eviction moratorium for all residents in New York state at the time, I-House was not subject to the policy because its residents are not “tenants” and I-House is not a “landlord.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  A University official wrote in a statement to Spectator that when I-House vacated all of the units in its south building because of the pandemic, the housing community ended all of its lease agreements, including those with Columbia. After I-House reopened in fall 2021, it completely severed its application process from the University. Information about I-House is still available on the Columbia Residential website, but the University points students toward the I-House independent application form.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Though residence at I-House is typically limited to three academic years, residents can ask to extend their membership as long as they maintain eligibility, their membership is in “good standing,” and they reapply by the posted deadline, the membership agreement reads. Still, an extension is not guaranteed.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Applications for extension and renewal of resident membership are subject to review and written approval by the Admissions Committee, and admission is not guaranteed,” the membership agreement reads.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  During the pandemic, I-House decided to “temporarily relax and adapt” its policy on residents only being allowed to live there for three academic years, according to a copy of a 2023 email obtained by Spectator from Megan Amouzuo, vice president of admissions at I-House.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  By 2023, however, I-House was reinstating the prior policy because the pandemic had “greatly subsided.” In line with its policy of three academic years, I-House removed CoryTerrell Jenkins, a former resident, with little notice. Without I-House, Jenkins was forced into the city’s shelter system.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  After his first year at I-House, Jenkins, who described growing up in poverty, scored a scholarship to live at the residence.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “International House saved my life,” he wrote in a June 2024 letter to I-House.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The morning of Jenkins’ graduation from the Atlantic Acting School in the spring of 2024, he was admitted into the hospital for extreme food poisoning. His medical bills racked up to $7,000. The next week, he lost his job, began experiencing depression, and didn’t have enough money to eat regularly. He detailed all of these experiences in a June 2, 2024, letter he sent to I-House administrators.
</p>

  “Please note that we do not consider the duration of study, difficulty in securing alternate accommodations or one’s personal needs for facilities offered by the I-House community as unexpected exceptional hardships,” an I-House admissions email obtained by Spectator read.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Jenkins was overdue on his membership fees, but devised a five-point plan which included working at the I-House dining hall, continuing to search for acting jobs, seeing an I-House therapist, working with the I-House Programs team for résumé coaching, and sending I-House monthly updates on his progress, a copy of the letter obtained by Spectator read.

  Amid the Trump administration’s crackdown on international students, Amouzuo, the vice president of admissions, sent I-House residents an email on March 28 that committed to “reviewing several existing admissions policies in light of the current challenges facing students, particularly international students,” according to a copy of the email obtained by Spectator.
</p>

  Aya sent an extension request to I-House in June, describing the ways in which <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/18/ice-nyc-protest-00572418">ICE detentions</a> in New York City had deeply impacted her life and made her fear for her safety.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  On July 29, Amouzou emailed Aya informing her that her request to stay in I-House for a fourth year had been rejected, according to an email obtained by Spectator. Amouzou told her she had until Aug. 18 to move out—less than three weeks later, according to the email.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When Spectator reached Amouzou for comment, an I-House spokesperson declined to comment on her behalf.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “I had just started working somewhere, hadn’t gotten my first paycheck, and I was extremely overwhelmed because all of a sudden, I was like, ‘I don’t know where I’m going to live,’” Aya said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  When she asked why her extension request was not accepted, administrators gave her conflicting responses. Aya said some administrators told her that they could not accommodate her because of a shortage of available units, extenuating balance, or because she had not submitted proof of employment. Aya told Spectator that she was willing to address all of those issues with administrators.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “They just didn’t want me to live here,” Aya said.

  Joshua had a similar experience after applying to live in I-House for an additional year in 2024: He said he never heard back. Instead, he moved in with Emma, a Columbia student using a pseudonym fearing retaliation from I-House, and was listed as her partner.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  As Emma’s three-year term came to a close in May, both Emma and Joshua met with Amouzou to discuss staying in I-House for an additional year. According to the residents, Amouzou told them their extension filing and meeting was “just a formality.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  But on Aug. 13, Emma received departure notice asking Emma—and by extension, Joshua—to vacate by Aug. 20, less than a week later. According to Emma, this was her first notice of departure since her meeting with Amouzou in June.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “They could have given us all summer to figure it out—alternative housing—and they didn’t,” Joshua said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In emails obtained by Spectator, Amouzou wrote to the residents that the denial had been in line with their meeting in June.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  On Aug. 19, Amouzou emailed Emma, reminding her that her checkout date was on Aug. 20.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Your request to stay longer was not approved and that is the final answer,” Amouzo wrote in the Aug. 19 email, obtained by Spectator, citing the arrival of another resident who would need the unit shortly thereafter.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It was your decision to put someone in a room that people lived in and then not give them ample notice that they needed to leave,” Joshua added.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  In protest, and left with scarce options, Emma and Joshua refused to move out of the unit within the given timeframe.

  At one point, I-House deactivated Emma’s ID, preventing her from accessing the building, she said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Emma said she “barricaded” herself in her room for two weeks, only leaving the building after 5 p.m., when the administrators had completed their shifts, to go buy food, she said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “They’re putting me in this position where I basically have to guard my stuff with my physical body, so that they don’t do anything to it,” Emma said.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Emma said that several administrators knocked on her door and entered her room without her permission on Sept. 5. She said that in one instance, she told the administrators that she was not fully clothed and one walked in anyways.

  The “resident membership agreement” gives I-House personnel the right to enter residents’ rooms without prior notice for health, safety, and emergency responses, to make repairs, or when they believe a resident is violating laws or I-House regulations.

  “A landlord always has the right in an emergency to enter into your apartment without notice,” Altman, the student defense lawyer, said. “But, it has to be a true emergency.”

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Under New York City tenant law, lockouts—when someone is denied entry to their home—are illegal, if the tenant has lived in the same place for at least 30 days, even if they have not signed a lease. A lockout is only legal when the tenant has been delivered a court order by a marshal or sheriff.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The city’s Public Engagement Unit recommends that in the case of a lockout, tenants call 311—a hotline for nonemergency services—and 911, as lockouts are a misdemeanor under “illegal eviction law.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  Emma told Spectator she called 311 and 911 on Aug. 22 when I-House restricted her access to the building, which prompted the New York Police Department to arrive at I-House. In an Aug. 22 email obtained by Spectator the house manager at I-House’s department of public safety and guest services, notified Emma that Amouzuo had reactivated her ID.

            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  One week after the confrontation, Emma and Joshua met with Amouzou and Sebastian Fries, I-House president and CEO, according to emails between the administrators and the residents. Afterward, the administrators offered the two the option to stay in I-House until December under the provision they would be moved to different units. They offered a similar deadline to Aya.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The leases at I-House normally start in September and end in May, coinciding with the academic year. The students had expressed their desire to administrators to stay in I-House until the end of the academic year in May 2026.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  I-House sent the students an email on Oct. 7 with a licensing agreement and a copy of the  membership agreement dated Oct. 6. The email asked the students to sign the agreement by Oct. 13, but the licensing agreement did not include this deadline.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The licensing agreement also stresses that the licensee, or the occupant, would not have any rights of tenancy in the new unit.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The last clause of the agreement states that “the parties represent and warrant to each other that they have had the opportunity to retain counsel to review this agreement and they fully understand each and every provision of this Agreement.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  On Monday, Oct. 13, Emma and Joshua informed I-House in emails obtained by Spectator that they were refusing to sign the agreement or pay their first installment of rent by the date I-House set due to a lack of time to consult legal counsel.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “Giving me a week during midterms to review this information is not fair,” Emma told Spectator. “Contacting lawyers takes time and then they have to actually sit and look through everything. So I think that they’re just trying to push us into a corner.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The agreement also asks the students to pay their rent in two installments. The first installment was due Wednesday, Oct. 15, and the second would be due Nov. 15.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  The agreement states that I-House will deem a failure to make the payment on time to be a “breach of substantial obligation of this Agreement by the Licensee.” The agreement also states that the residents may be subject to a late fee of 10 percent, amounting to over $500, and gives I-House the right to terminate the license and this agreement immediately.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  However, even prior to the payment deadline expiring, I-House began changing the residents’ access to dining. On Aug. 29, the day the students were granted access to a new unit, I-House charged Emma, Joshua, and Aya for a dining plan—a charge of $992. On Sept. 2, the first day of classes at Columbia, I-House reversed the charge. At I-House, every resident opts in to a dining plan, which gives them credits to use at the dining hall. By reversing the charge, the three residents are prevented from using these credits.
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  On Wednesday, Oct. 15, Fries emailed the residents informing them that I-House had turned the matter over to its legal counsel, and urged the residents’ lawyers to contact I-House counsel directly.

  Altman said that housing court judges look “very dimly on landlords locking out residents.”
</p>

  “New York City has a very robust body of law associated with the relationship between landlords and tenants, and you can’t ask people to just simply waive that,” Altman said.

  Jenkins said regardless of any of the financial policies that I-House maintains, he believes the organization owes its residents “humanity.”
</p>

          
      
        
            <p class="g-body paragraph">
  “It’s unfortunate. That building doesn’t need to be like that,” Jenkins said. “The building has all the money and resources, years and years of history to just take care of its humans. But it chose to be like that.”
